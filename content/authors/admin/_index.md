I am Charles (He/Him), an MSc Plant Genetics and Crop Improvement student at the John Innes Centre, Norwich UK. I am researching wheat genetics with the aim to contribute to efforts to designing future wheat. In 2022, I will begin a PhD at the Earlham Institute, Norwich, developing next-generation sequencing applications in the vegetable breeding industry.

I spend much of my spare time exploring the Norfolk countryside and its hidden treasures, at all paces - you might find me sitting, walking, running or cycling. I love endurance sports - connect with me on Strava. When I find myself indoors, I am a sports enthusiast, programmer and consumer of science.
